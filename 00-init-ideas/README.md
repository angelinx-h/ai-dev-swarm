## Overview

This stage transforms the initial idea for an MCP Skills Server into professional project documentation. The goal is to enable AI agents without built-in skills support to access the dev-swarms agent skills feature through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Stage Deliverables

This stage produces the following documentation:

1. **[problem-statement.md](./problem-statement.md)** - Defines the core problem we're solving
2. **[target-users.md](./target-users.md)** - Identifies who will use this MCP server
3. **[value-proposition.md](./value-proposition.md)** - Articulates the unique value we provide
4. **[owner-requirement.md](./owner-requirement.md)** - Lists all initial requirements from the business owner

## Next Steps

After completing this stage, proceed to:
- **Stage 1: Market Research** - Validate the problem and analyze existing MCP servers and skill systems
