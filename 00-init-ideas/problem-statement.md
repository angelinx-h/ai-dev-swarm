# Problem Statement

## The Problem

Many AI agents and platforms do not have built-in skills support, which limits their ability to leverage structured, reusable development workflows. Specifically, AI agents that are not Claude Code cannot easily access and utilize the dev-swarms agent skills feature, which provides a comprehensive 10-stage development methodology from idea to deployment.

## Current Pain Points

1. **Limited Skill Access**: AI agents without native skills support cannot use the dev-swarms framework effectively
2. **Fragmented Workflows**: Development teams must manually recreate workflows for different AI agents
3. **Integration Barriers**: No standardized way to expose skills to external AI agents
4. **Context Injection Challenge**: Difficulty in providing skill context and instructions to AI agents at runtime

## Why This Matters

The dev-swarms framework represents a proven methodology for AI-powered development, covering everything from market research to deployment. Making this accessible to a broader ecosystem of AI agents through the standardized MCP protocol will:

- Enable more development teams to adopt structured AI-powered workflows
- Increase the value and reach of the dev-swarms framework
- Promote interoperability in the AI development tools ecosystem
- Reduce duplication of effort across different AI platforms

## Success Criteria

The problem will be considered solved when:
- Any MCP-compatible AI agent can discover and use dev-swarms skills
- Skills are properly contextualized when invoked by external agents
- File paths and references work correctly from the AI agent's perspective
- The integration is seamless and requires minimal configuration
