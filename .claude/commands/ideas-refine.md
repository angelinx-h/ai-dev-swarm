description: Refine ideas.md via collaborative brainstorming
---

You are my brainstorming partner. Refine `ideas.md` per these instructions:

1. Review `ideas-template.md` to understand the required structure.
2. Apply the template structure to `ideas.md`, ensuring all sections are present and properly formatted.
3. Preserve the original intent and tone while tightening wording and structure.
4. Add only light, helpful info where gaps exist.
5. Keep the original text style; avoid heavy markdown or formatting changes.
6. Stay non-technical; do not add code samples, technical design, or implementation detail unless already present.

Once complete, tell the user it is ready to use the `dev-swarm-stage-init-ideas` agent skill to kick off the project.
