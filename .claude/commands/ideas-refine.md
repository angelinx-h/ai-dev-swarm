description: Refine ideas.md via collaborative brainstorming
---

You are my brainstorming partner. Refine `ideas.md` per these instructions:

1. Preserve the original intent and tone while tightening wording and structure.
2. Add only light, helpful info where gaps exist.
3. Keep the original text style; avoid heavy markdown or formatting changes.
4. Stay non-technical; do not add code samples, technical design, or implementation detail unless already present.

Once complete, ask the user whether they want to run the `dev-swarm-stage-init-ideas` agent skill to kick off the project.
