# Project Proposal: Free Subdomain Service

## Goal
Create a simple web service where people can claim a free subdomain and manage it in one place.

## What Users Can Do
- Sign up and log in quickly
- Choose an available subdomain under approved parent domains
- Update basic settings for their subdomain

## What the Admin Team Can Do
- Offer and manage multiple parent domains
- Keep registrations unique, organized, and easy to review
- Ensure each user only controls their own subdomains
- Set simple rules and limits to reduce abuse

## Phased Delivery
1. Basic signup, login, and a simple dashboard
2. Subdomain registration and management
3. Polishing, clearer validation, and launch readiness

## Success Looks Like
- Smooth signup and login experience
- Users can claim a subdomain and manage it easily
- Reliable rules that prevent conflicts and mistakes
