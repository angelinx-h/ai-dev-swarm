# Stage 05 - UX Design

Design the user experience including visual design system, wireframes, user flows, responsive guidelines, and accessibility requirements to create a cohesive and user-centered product interface.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to start stage 05 (ux)
- User wants to create wireframes or design system
- User asks about UI design, accessibility, or responsive design

## Your Roles in This Skill

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for role selection guidance.

## Role Communication

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for the required role announcement format.

## Pre-Stage Check

Before starting, verify previous stages:

1. Check if `00-init-ideas/` through `04-prd/` folders have content (not just `.gitkeep`)
2. If any previous stage is empty and has no `SKIP.md`:
   - Ask user: "Stage {XX} is not complete. Would you like to skip it or start from that stage first?"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context Review

Read all files to understand the project:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/*.md` through `04-prd/*.md` - All markdown files

### Step 2: Create Stage Proposal

**General Rules:** See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` → "Create Stage Proposal Rules" section.

Create the file `05-ux/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why UX design is critical for product success and user adoption
- How this builds upon previous stages (personas, MVP scope, PRD)
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Select files from these options based on project needs:

**Design System:**
- `design-system-guide.md` - Color palette, typography, spacing, and button styles
- `design-ui-preview.html` - Sample HTML/CSS/JS page demonstrating the design system

**Wireframes & Layouts:**
- `wireframe_descriptions.md` - Textual descriptions of UI layout for each key screen

**User Flows & Navigation:**
- `user-flows/` - User navigation flow diagrams

**Responsive & Accessibility:**
- `responsive-design.md` - Guidelines for how UI adapts across screen sizes
- `accessibility.md` - Accessibility requirements following WCAG guidelines

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description
- Why it's essential for this project
- Key information it should include

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Ask user: "Please check the Stage Proposal in `05-ux/README.md`. Update it directly or tell me how to update it."

### Step 3: Execute Stage Plan

Once user approves `05-ux/README.md`:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive content based on personas, MVP requirements, and PRD
- **For diagram folders:** Follow `dev-swarm/docs/mermaid-diagram-guide.md` to create related diagrams files
- **For `.html` files:** Create functional preview pages demonstrating the design system with css/js as needed

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base design decisions on user personas and their needs
- Align UX with MVP features defined in stage 03
- Ensure all user flows support functional requirements from stage 04
- Accessibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key design decisions and rationale
- Ask: "Please review the UX design files. You can update or delete files, or let me know how to modify them."

### Step 4: Finalize Stage

Once user approves all files:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync `05-ux/README.md` to remove any deleted files
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Check that all diagrams render correctly
- Validate HTML preview displays correctly

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize key design decisions for reference in architecture stage
- Note any technical constraints discovered during UX design

#### 4.3 Announce Completion

Inform user:
- "Stage 05 (UX Design) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key design decisions made
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 06 (Architecture) when you are"

## Stage Completion Rules

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for stage completion, commit, and skip rules.

## Key Principles

- Base design on user personas and needs
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Keep design consistent across all screens
- Support smooth transition to architecture design
