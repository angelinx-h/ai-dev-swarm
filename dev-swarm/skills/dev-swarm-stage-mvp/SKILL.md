# Stage 03 - MVP

Define the Minimum Viable Product scope, prioritize features, establish success criteria, and create a focused roadmap to deliver the smallest testable product that validates core assumptions.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to start stage 03 (mvp)
- User wants to define MVP scope or prioritize features
- User asks about feature prioritization or release planning

## Your Roles in This Skill

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for role selection guidance.

## Role Communication

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for the required role announcement format.

## Pre-Stage Check

Before starting, verify previous stages:

1. Check if `00-init-ideas/`, `01-market-research/`, `02-personas/` folders have content (not just `.gitkeep`)
2. If any previous stage is empty and has no `SKIP.md`:
   - Ask user: "Stage {XX} is not complete. Would you like to skip it or start from that stage first?"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context Review

Read all files to understand the project:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/*.md` - All markdown files
- `01-market-research/*.md` - All markdown files
- `02-personas/*.md` - All markdown files

### Step 2: Create Stage Proposal

**General Rules:** See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` → "Create Stage Proposal Rules" section.

Create the file `03-mvp/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why defining MVP scope is critical for product success
- How this builds upon previous stages
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Select files from these options based on project needs:

**Core MVP Definition:**
- `mvp-features.md` - Core MVP features that must be included for initial launch
- `feature-prioritization.md` - Feature priority matrix using MoSCoW or similar framework
- `mvp-roadmap/` - Roadmap diagrams showing MVP development phases

**Scope Management:**
- `mvp-scope.md` - Explicit in-scope features with acceptance criteria
- `out-of-scope.md` - Features explicitly deferred to future versions

**Success & Release:**
- `success-criteria.md` - Measurable MVP success criteria
- `release-plan.md` - MVP release plan including launch strategy

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description
- Why it's essential for this project
- Key information it should include

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Ask user: "Please check the Stage Proposal in `03-mvp/README.md`. Update it directly or tell me how to update it."

### Step 3: Execute Stage Plan

Once user approves `03-mvp/README.md`:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive content based on insights from previous stages
- **For diagram folders:** Follow `dev-swarm/docs/mermaid-diagram-guide.md` to create related diagrams files

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base MVP features on validated user pain points from personas
- Use market research to identify competitive differentiation
- Apply feature prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, Kano)
- Ensure MVP scope is achievable and focused
- Include clear rationale for what's in-scope vs out-of-scope

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight the core MVP value proposition
- List key features included and excluded
- Ask: "Please review the MVP definition. You can update or delete files, or let me know how to modify them."

### Step 4: Finalize Stage

Once user approves all files:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync `03-mvp/README.md` to remove any deleted files
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Check that all diagrams render correctly

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize MVP scope for reference in later stages
- Identify key technical requirements implied by MVP features

#### 4.3 Announce Completion

Inform user:
- "Stage 03 (MVP) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Core MVP features and scope boundaries
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 04 (PRD) when you are"

## Stage Completion Rules

See `dev-swarm/docs/general-dev-stage-rule.md` for stage completion, commit, and skip rules.

## Key Principles

- Focus on smallest testable product
- Base features on validated user needs
- Keep scope achievable and focused
- Support smooth transition to PRD definition
