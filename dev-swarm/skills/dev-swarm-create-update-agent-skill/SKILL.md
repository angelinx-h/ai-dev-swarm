# AI Builder - Create/Update Agent Skill

This skill helps you create new agent skills or update existing ones following the Agent Skills specification and dev-swarm conventions.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to create a new skill
- User asks to update an existing skill
- User wants to add functionality as a reusable skill
- User wants to modify skill documentation or behavior

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Project Manager**: Coordinate the skill creation/update process, ensure all required sections are included, and verify adherence to specifications.
- **Backend Developer**: Implement the skill structure, write clear instructions, and ensure proper file organization.
- **Technical Writer**: Document the skill clearly with examples, usage guidelines, and role communication patterns.

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to create or update an agent skill:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements

  **Ask the user for clarification if needed:**
   - What is the skill name? (must start with `dev-swarm-`, lowercase, hyphens only)
   - What does the skill do?
   - When should this skill be used?
   - What roles are involved in this skill?

### Step 2: Create or Locate the Skill Directory

**For new skills:**

1. Create the skill directory: `dev-swarm/skills/dev-swarm-{skill-name}/`
2. Create any needed subdirectories:
   - `references/` for reference documentation (preferred)
   - `scripts/` for executable scripts (if needed)
   - `assets/` for static resources (if needed)

**For existing skills:**

1. Locate the existing skill directory: `dev-swarm/skills/dev-swarm-{skill-name}/`
2. Read the existing `SKILL.md` to understand current structure

### Step 3: Create/Update SKILL.md

The `SKILL.md` file must contain:

#### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: dev-swarm-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

**Frontmatter requirements:**
- `name`: Must start with `dev-swarm-`, match directory name, lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 characters
- `description`: Max 1024 characters, describe what it does AND when to use it

**Optional frontmatter fields:**
- `metadata`: Additional key-value metadata (author, version, etc.)
- `allowed-tools`: Pre-approved tools (experimental)

#### Required Sections

**1. Skill Title and Introduction**
```markdown
# AI Builder - {Skill Name}

Brief introduction describing what this skill does.
```

**2. When to Use This Skill**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

- Bullet point describing use case 1
- Bullet point describing use case 2
- etc.
```

**3. Your Roles in This Skill** (REQUIRED)
```markdown
## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Role Name**: Description of what this role does in this skill
- **Role Name**: Description of what this role does in this skill
```

Choose roles from file `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md`:

**4. Role Communication** (REQUIRED)
```markdown
## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a {Role}, I will {action description}
- As a {Role}, I will {action description}

**Note:** Combine multiple roles when performing related tasks. For example: "As a Tech Manager and Backend Architect, I will..." or "As a Frontend Architect and AI Engineer, I will..."

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.
```

**5. Instructions**
```markdown
## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: {Step Title}

Detailed instructions for this step...

### Step 2: {Step Title}

Detailed instructions for this step...

(Continue with all necessary steps)
```

#### Recommended Sections

- **Examples**: Show concrete examples of usage
- **Expected Output**: Describe what the skill produces
- **Key Principles**: List important guidelines
- **Common Issues**: Document known problems and solutions

### Step 4: Create Reference Files (if needed)

If your skill needs additional reference documentation, prefer routing details to `references/` files to keep `SKILL.md` short.

Use this conditional routing format:

- If {situation 1}, refer to `references/{file-1}.md`.
- If {situation 2}, refer to `references/{file-2}.md`.

Include conditions for platform, scale, or software type when relevant. Examples:

- If platform-specific requirements apply (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, backend/API, data/ML), refer to `references/platform-{platform}.md`.
- If scale/type requirements apply (prototype, MVP, growth, enterprise; SaaS, internal tools, data pipeline, open source), refer to `references/scale-{level}.md` or `references/type-{type}.md`.

**Reference file guidance:**
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Link to them from `SKILL.md` using relative paths
- Use a symbolic link for any file under `dev-swarm/` in the project's root if asked to reference an entire file

### Step 5: Add Scripts (if needed)

If your skill includes executable scripts:

1. **Create `scripts/` directory**
2. **Add scripts** that are:
   - Self-contained or clearly document dependencies
   - Include helpful error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

### Step 6: Validate the Skill

**Check the following:**

1. **Frontmatter validation:**
   - [ ] `name` starts with `dev-swarm-`
   - [ ] `name` matches directory name
   - [ ] `name` is lowercase with hyphens only
   - [ ] `description` is clear and under 1024 characters

2. **Required sections present:**
   - [ ] Skill title and introduction
   - [ ] "When to Use This Skill"
   - [ ] "Your Roles in This Skill"
   - [ ] "Role Communication"
   - [ ] "Instructions"

3. **Content quality:**
   - [ ] Instructions are clear and step-by-step
   - [ ] Roles are appropriate for the task
   - [ ] Examples are provided where helpful
   - [ ] File references use relative paths
   - [ ] `SKILL.md` is concise, defers details to references

4. **File structure:**
   - [ ] No references outside skill folder (unless explicitly required)
   - [ ] Reference files are focused and appropriately sized
   - [ ] Scripts are properly documented

### Step 7: Test the Skill (Optional)

If possible, test the skill by:
1. Walking through the instructions manually
2. Verifying all file references work
3. Checking that role assignments make sense
4. Ensuring the output meets expectations

### Step 8: Ask for User Confirmation

Show the user:
1. The skill name and location
2. Summary of what the skill does
3. List of files created/updated
4. Any additional notes or recommendations

Ask: "The skill has been created/updated. Would you like me to make any changes?"

## Key Principles

- **Follow the specification**: Always adhere to file `dev-swarm/docs/agent-skill-specification.md`
- **Clear instructions**: Write step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow
- **Appropriate roles**: Choose roles that match the task from file `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md`
- **Progressive disclosure**: Keep SKILL.md concise, move detailed content to reference files
- **Self-contained**: Don't reference files outside the skill folder unless required
- **Role communication**: Always include the role communication pattern
- **Validate thoroughly**: Check all requirements before considering the skill complete
- **Naming convention**: All skill names must start with `dev-swarm-`

## Common Issues

**Issue: Skill name doesn't match directory**
- Solution: Ensure the `name` in frontmatter exactly matches the directory name

**Issue: Skill name doesn't start with dev-swarm-**
- Solution: All dev-swarm skills must be named `dev-swarm-{skill-name}`

**Issue: Missing required sections**
- Solution: Always include "Your Roles in This Skill" and "Role Communication"

**Issue: Description too vague**
- Solution: Describe both WHAT the skill does and WHEN to use it
