# Stage 09 - Sprints

Plan and execute agile development sprints, breaking down the product requirements into manageable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, developer test plans, and QA verification points to deliver incremental, demo-able product milestones.

## Instructions

### 1. Context Review

Read all the files below to understand the design of this project so far:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/` - All markdown files
- `01-market-research/` - All markdown files
- `02-personas/` - All markdown files
- `03-mvp/` - All markdown files
- `04-prd/` - All markdown files
- `05-ux/` - All markdown files
- `06-architecture/` - All markdown files
- `07-tech-specs/` - All markdown files
- `08-devops/` - All markdown files

### 2. Create Stage Proposal

Create the file `09-sprints/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal of this stage in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve (sprint planning, backlog creation, development execution)
- Why agile sprint development is critical for iterative delivery and user feedback
- How this stage transforms technical specifications into working software
- What deliverables will be produced (working features, tested code, demo-able increments)

#### 2.2 Sprint Overview

Provide a high-level sprint breakdown:
- **Total number of sprints** planned for MVP delivery
- **Sprint duration** - AI-driven development (typically 5-10 minutes per sprint)
- **Sprint naming convention** using format: `SPRINT-XX-descriptive-name/`
- **Brief description** of what each sprint will deliver

Example sprint overview:
```
Sprint 1: User Authentication - Login, registration, session management
Sprint 2: Profile Basics - User profile CRUD, avatar upload
Sprint 3: Core Feature A - Main product functionality
...
```

#### 2.3 Backlog Naming Convention

Explain the backlog file naming convention:
- Format: `FEATURE-XX-unique-keywords.md`
- **Keywords must be unique** across the entire project (e.g., `auth-login`, `profile-avatar`, `dashboard-analytics`)
- Keywords enable easy searching and cross-referencing across sprints

#### 2.4 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in `09-sprints/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Create Development Plan

Once the user approves the README.md, create `09-sprints/development-plan.md`:

#### 3.1 Development Plan Structure

The development plan should include:

**Sprint Breakdown:**
For each sprint, document:
- Sprint number and name
- Sprint goal (one sentence)
- Features/backlogs included (with unique keywords)
- Dependencies on previous sprints
- Demo criteria (what can be shown to stakeholders)
- QA test plan (how end users/QA will verify the sprint)

**Backlog Details:**
For each backlog item, document:
- Backlog ID and unique keywords (e.g., `FEATURE-01-auth-login`)
- User story format: "As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria (testable conditions)
- Developer test plan (unit tests, integration tests)
- Related files from previous stages (PRD section, UX wireframe, API spec)
- Estimated complexity (S/M/L)

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Each backlog must be independently testable from a developer perspective
- Each sprint must be demo-able and testable from QA/end-user perspective
- Dependencies between backlogs must be clearly documented
- All backlogs must trace back to PRD requirements
- Test plans must cover happy path and edge cases

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Development Plan

After creating the development plan, present it to the user:
- Provide a summary of sprints and total backlog count
- Highlight any high-risk or complex backlogs
- List dependencies and critical path
- Ask: "Please review the development plan in `09-sprints/development-plan.md`. You can update or let me know how to modify it"

#### 3.3 Revise Based on Feedback

If the user requests changes:
- Update the development plan according to user feedback
- Re-present the updated plan for approval
- Repeat until user approves the development plan

### 4. Create Sprint Folders and Backlogs

Once the user approves the development plan, create the sprint structure:

#### 4.1 Create Sprint Folders

For each sprint, create:
```
09-sprints/SPRINT-XX-name/
├─ README.md                    # Sprint overview
└─ FEATURE-XX-keywords.md       # Individual backlogs
```

#### 4.2 Sprint README.md Structure

Each sprint's README.md should contain:

```markdown
# Sprint XX - [Sprint Name]

## Sprint Status
**Status:** pending | in_progress | completed | blocked
**Started:** [timestamp or N/A]
**Completed:** [timestamp or N/A]

## Sprint Goal
[One sentence describing what this sprint delivers]


## Dependencies
- Requires: [Previous sprint or external dependency]
- Blocks: [Subsequent sprints that depend on this]

## Backlogs

- **FEATURE-01** `auth-login` - User login functionality
  - Status: pending | in_progress | completed
  - Complexity: S/M/L

- **FEATURE-02** `auth-register` - User registration
  - Status: pending | in_progress | completed
  - Complexity: S/M/L

- **FEATURE-03** `auth-session` - Session management
  - Status: pending | in_progress | completed
  - Complexity: S/M/L

## Sprint Test Plan (QA/End-User Verification)

### Test Scenarios
1. [Scenario 1 - End-to-end user flow]
2. [Scenario 2 - Key functionality verification]
...

### Demo Script
[Step-by-step demo for stakeholders]

### Success Criteria

```

#### 4.3 Backlog File Structure

Each backlog file (e.g., `FEATURE-01-auth-login.md`) should contain:

```markdown
# FEATURE-XX: [Feature Title]

**Keywords:** `keyword1-keyword2` (unique across project)

## User Story
As a [user type], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

## Related Documentation
- PRD: `04-prd/functional-requirements.md#section`

```

#### 4.4 Request User Approval for Sprint Structure

After creating all sprint folders and backlogs:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- List total sprints, total backlogs, and complexity distribution
- Ask: "Please review the sprint structure and backlog files. You can update or delete files, or let me know how to modify them"

### 5. Finalize Sprint Documentation

Once the user approves all sprint and backlog files:

#### 5.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync with `09-sprints/README.md` to remove any deleted files
- Ensure all backlog keywords are unique across the project
- Verify all backlogs trace back to PRD requirements
- Confirm all test plans are complete and actionable
- Validate all dependencies are correctly documented

#### 5.2 Announce Documentation Complete
Inform the user:
- "Sprint planning documentation is complete and ready for development"
- Summary of sprints and backlogs created
- Total estimated complexity
- Recommended sprint order


## Role Communication

Based on the stage context and project details, pick up your roles from `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

**As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}**

## Communication Pattern

This communication pattern ensures:
- **Transparency** - Users know exactly what features are being developed
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** - Users can approve sprint scope and review completed work
- **Role clarity** - Clear understanding of which expertise is being applied
- **Traceability** - Easy to track which backlog produced which code changes
- **Quality** - Users can verify each increment meets their expectations

Always announce your role and action before:
- Reading and analyzing documents
- Creating sprint and backlog documentation
- Making technical implementation decisions
- Starting development on a backlog
- Completing and requesting review of features
- Finalizing sprint deliverables
