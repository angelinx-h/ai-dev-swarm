# Stage 03 - MVP

Define the Minimum Viable Product scope, prioritize features, establish success criteria, and create a focused roadmap to deliver the smallest testable product that validates core assumptions.

## Instructions

### 1. Context Review

Read all the files below to understand the design of this project so far:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/` - All markdown files
- `01-market-research/` - All markdown files
- `02-personas/` - All markdown files

### 2. Create Stage Proposal

Create the file `03-mvp/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal of this stage in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why defining MVP scope is critical for product success
- How this stage builds upon previous stages (personas, market research, and init-ideas)
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Pick and list the file names from the options below that are most suitable for this project:

**Core MVP Definition:**
- `mvp-features.md` - Core MVP features that must be included for initial launch
- `feature-prioritization.md` - Feature priority matrix using MoSCoW or similar framework
- `mvp-roadmap.mmd` - Mermaid roadmap diagram showing MVP development phases

**Scope Management:**
- `mvp-scope.md` - Explicit in-scope features with acceptance criteria
- `out-of-scope.md` - Features explicitly deferred to future versions with rationale

**Success & Release:**
- `success-criteria.md` - Measurable MVP success criteria and validation metrics
- `release-plan.md` - MVP release plan including launch strategy and rollout phases

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description of what the file contains
- Why it's essential for this specific project
- What key information it should include

**Note:** Select files based on project complexity and type. Not all files may be necessary for every project.

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in file `03-mvp/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Execute Stage Plan

Once the user updates & approves the plan in `03-mvp/README.md`, read the file and understand user's update for the next step:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README.md within the `03-mvp/` folder:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive, well-structured content based on insights from previous stages
- **For `.mmd` files:** Create clear Mermaid diagrams (roadmaps, timelines) using appropriate syntax

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base MVP features on validated user pain points from personas
- Use market research to identify competitive differentiation opportunities
- Apply feature prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, Kano)
- Ensure MVP scope is achievable and focused on core value proposition
- Define measurable success criteria tied to business goals
- Include clear rationale for what's in-scope vs out-of-scope
- Map features to specific personas and user stories

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files, present them to the user:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight the core MVP value proposition
- List the key features included and excluded
- Ask: "Please review the MVP definition. You can update or delete the files or let me know how to do it"

### 4. Finalize Stage

Once the user approves all files, you need to check all the files content, and if any files have been deleted understand the user's intent:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync with `03-mvp/README.md`, to remove any deleted files which the user doesn't want to have
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Verify that MVP scope aligns with personas and market research findings
- Confirm success criteria are specific, measurable, and achievable
- Check that all Mermaid diagrams render correctly

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize the MVP scope for reference in later stages
- Identify key technical requirements implied by MVP features
- Note dependencies and constraints for PRD (stage 04)
- Highlight any assumptions that need validation

#### 4.3 Announce Completion
Inform the user:
- "Stage 03 (MVP) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Core MVP features and scope boundaries
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 04 (PRD) when you are"

## Role Communication

Based on the stage context and project details, pick up your roles from `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

**As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}**

## Communication Pattern

This communication pattern ensures:
- **Transparency** - Users know exactly what you're doing and why
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** - Users can intervene at key decision points
- **Role clarity** - Clear understanding of which expertise is being applied
- **Traceability** - Easy to track which role made which decisions

Always announce your role and action before:
- Reading and analyzing documents
- Creating new files or documents
- Making recommendations or decisions
- Requesting user approval
- Finalizing deliverables
