- How this stage builds upon the init-ideas stage
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Pick and list the file names from the options below that are most suitable for this project:

**Market Analysis:**
- `competitive-analysis.md` - In-depth analysis of direct and indirect competitors, their strengths, weaknesses, pricing, and positioning
- `similar-products.md` - Research on similar products in the market, their features, user reviews, and market reception
- `market-size-opportunity.md` - Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM) analysis

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in file `01-market-research/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Execute Stage Plan

Once the user updates & approves the plan in `01-market-research/README.md`, read the file and understand user's update for the next step:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README.md within the `01-market-research/` folder:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive, well-structured content based on actual web research and insights from the init-ideas stage

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Use web search to gather real market data and competitor information
- Cite sources where possible for credibility
- Include quantitative data (market size, growth rates, pricing) when available
- Analyze at least 3-5 direct competitors and 2-3 indirect competitors
- Identify specific, actionable market opportunities
- Connect findings back to the product concept from init-ideas
- Use tables and structured formats for easy comparison

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files, present them to the user:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key market insights discovered
- Ask: "Please review the market research documents. You can update or delete the files or let me know how to do it"

### 4. Finalize Stage

Once the user approves all files, you need to check all the files content, and if any files have been deleted understand the user's intent:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync with `01-market-research/README.md`, to remove any deleted files which the user doesn't want to have
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Verify that research findings are accurate and well-sourced
- Confirm market analysis is comprehensive and actionable
- Check that all data and statistics are properly cited

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage

#### 4.3 Announce Completion
Inform the user:
- "Stage 01 (Market Research) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key insights discovered
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 02 (Personas) when you are"

## Role Communication

## Communication Pattern
