# Stage 02 - Personas

Create detailed user personas and user stories based on market research and business requirements to deeply understand target users' needs, behaviors, pain points, and goals.

## Instructions

### 1. Context Review

Read all the files below to understand the design of this project so far:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/` - All markdown files
- `01-market-research/` - All markdown files

### 2. Create Stage Proposal

Create the file `02-personas/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal of this stage in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why user personas and stories are critical for product success
- How this stage builds upon previous stages (init-ideas and market-research)
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Pick and list the file names from the options below that are most suitable for this project:

**User Research & Personas:**
- `personas.md` - Detailed user personas with demographics, behaviors, motivations, and frustrations
- `pain-points.md` - Comprehensive list of user pain points identified from research
- `empathy-maps.mmd` - Mermaid diagrams visualizing what users say, think, do, and feel

**User Stories & Journeys:**
- `user-stories.md` - User stories in "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [benefit]" format
- `user-journey-maps.mmd` - Mermaid journey diagrams showing user interactions across touchpoints
- `use-cases.md` - Detailed use cases describing how different personas will use the product

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description of what the file contains
- Why it's essential for this specific project
- What key information it should include

**Note:** Select files based on project complexity and type. Not all files may be necessary for every project.

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in file `02-personas/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Execute Stage Plan

Once the user updates & approves the plan in `02-personas/README.md`, read the file and understand user's update for the next step:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README.md within the `02-personas/` folder:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive, well-structured content based on insights from previous stages
- **For `.mmd` files:** Create clear Mermaid diagrams (journey maps, empathy maps) using appropriate syntax

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base personas on real insights from market research, not assumptions
- Create 3-5 distinct personas representing different user segments
- Ensure user stories are specific, measurable, and actionable
- Include both primary and secondary personas if relevant
- Map pain points to specific personas
- Connect user journeys to business goals

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files, present them to the user:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key insights from the personas
- Ask: "Please review the personas and user stories. you can update or delete the files or let me know how to do it"

### 4. Finalize Stage

Once the user approves all files, you need to check all the files content, and if any files have been deleted understand the user's intent:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- sync with `02-personas/README.md`, to remove any deleted files which the user doesn't want to have
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Verify that personas align with market research findings
- Confirm user stories are comprehensive and cover key use cases
- Check that all Mermaid diagrams render correctly

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize key personas and insights for reference in later stages
- Identify which personas should be prioritized for MVP (stage 03)
- Note any open questions or assumptions that need validation

#### 4.3 Announce Completion
Inform the user:
- "Stage 02 (Personas) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key insights discovered
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 03 (MVP) when you are"

## Role Communication

Based on the stage context and project details, pick up your roles from `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

**As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}**

## Communication Pattern

This communication pattern ensures:
- **Transparency** - Users know exactly what you're doing and why
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** - Users can intervene at key decision points
- **Role clarity** - Clear understanding of which expertise is being applied
- **Traceability** - Easy to track which role made which decisions

Always announce your role and action before:
- Reading and analyzing documents
- Creating new files or documents
- Making recommendations or decisions
- Requesting user approval
- Finalizing deliverables
