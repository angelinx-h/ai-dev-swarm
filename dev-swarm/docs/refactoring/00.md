# Stage 00 - Init Ideas

Transform raw ideas into structured business requirements by clarifying the problem, defining the solution, identifying target users, and establishing success metrics.

## Instructions

### 1. Context Review

Read the ideas file to understand the user's initial concept:

- `ideas.md`

### 2. Create Stage Proposal

Create the file `00-init-ideas/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal of this stage in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve (transforming raw ideas into actionable business requirements)
- Why clarifying the problem and solution is critical before proceeding
- What deliverables will be produced
- How this stage sets the foundation for all subsequent stages

#### 2.2 File Selection

Pick and list the file names from the options below that are most suitable for this project:

**Problem & Solution Definition:**
- `problem-statement.md` - Clear articulation of the problem being solved, including current pain points and why existing solutions are inadequate
- `solution-overview.md` - High-level description of the proposed solution and its core value proposition

**Brainstorm:**
- `brainstorm-mindmap.mmd` - Mermaid mindmap that expands on user's initial ideas, exploring related features, alternative approaches, and potential directions to help shape product design
- `feature-opportunities.md` - New features and ideas discovered through brainstorming, presented for user review to decide which ones to incorporate into the product design

**Requirements & Users:**
- `quick-questions.md` - List of unknowns and clarification questions that need answers before proceeding
- `tech-requirements.md` - Technical requirements extracted from the ideas if have (platforms, integrations, constraints)
- `target-users.md` - Initial definition of target audience segments and their characteristics

**Success & Risk:**
- `success-metrics.md` - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and criteria for measuring success
- `assumptions-risks.md` - Key assumptions being made and potential risks to address

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description of what the file contains
- Why it's essential for this specific project
- What key information it should include

**Note:** Select files based on project complexity. For simple projects, fewer files may be needed. For complex projects, all files may be necessary.

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in file `00-init-ideas/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Execute Stage Plan

Once the user updates & approves the plan in `00-init-ideas/README.md`, read the file and understand user's update for the next step:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README.md within the `00-init-ideas/` folder:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive, well-structured content based on the ideas.md file
- **For `.mmd` files:** Create clear Mermaid diagrams (mindmaps, flowcharts) using appropriate syntax

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Extract and clarify implicit requirements from the ideas
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- Ensure problem statement is specific and measurable
- Define target users with enough detail for persona creation in Stage 02
- Establish realistic and measurable success metrics
- Identify risks early to address them in later stages
- Connect technical requirements to business goals

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files, present them to the user:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key insights and clarifications made
- Ask: "Please review the init-ideas documents. You can update or delete the files or let me know how to do it"

### 4. Finalize Stage

Once the user approves all files, you need to check all the files content, and if any files have been deleted understand the user's intent:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync with `00-init-ideas/README.md`, to remove any deleted files which the user doesn't want to have
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Verify that the problem statement aligns with the proposed solution
- Confirm success metrics are measurable and achievable
- Check that all Mermaid diagrams render correctly

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize key findings and decisions for reference in later stages
- Identify areas that need market research validation (Stage 01)
- Note any open questions that market research should answer

#### 4.3 Announce Completion
Inform the user:
- "Stage 00 (Init Ideas) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key insights discovered
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 01 (Market Research) when you are"

## Role Communication

Based on the stage context and project details, pick up your roles from `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

**As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}**

## Communication Pattern

This communication pattern ensures:
- **Transparency** - Users know exactly what you're doing and why
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** - Users can intervene at key decision points
- **Role clarity** - Clear understanding of which expertise is being applied
- **Traceability** - Easy to track which role made which decisions

Always announce your role and action before:
- Reading and analyzing documents
- Creating new files or documents
- Making recommendations or decisions
- Requesting user approval
- Finalizing deliverables
