# Stage 05 - UX Design

Design the user experience including visual design system, wireframes, user flows, responsive guidelines, and accessibility requirements to create a cohesive and user-centered product interface.

## Instructions

### 1. Context Review

Read all the files below to understand the design of this project so far:

- `ideas.md`
- `00-init-ideas/` - All markdown files
- `01-market-research/` - All markdown files
- `02-personas/` - All markdown files
- `03-mvp/` - All markdown files
- `04-prd/` - All markdown files

### 2. Create Stage Proposal

Create the file `05-ux/README.md` with the following content:

#### 2.1 Stage Goal

Brief the goal of this stage in 2-3 paragraphs:
- What this stage aims to achieve
- Why UX design is critical for product success and user adoption
- How this stage builds upon previous stages (personas, MVP scope, and PRD requirements)
- What deliverables will be produced

#### 2.2 File Selection

Pick and list the file names from the options below that are most suitable for this project:

**Design System:**
- `design-system-guide.md` - Color palette, typography choices, spacing, and button styles that define the visual language
- `design-ui-preview.html` - A sample HTML/CSS/JS page demonstrating the design system in action

**Wireframes & Layouts:**
- `wireframe_descriptions.md` - Textual descriptions of UI layout for each key screen, including element placement and hierarchy

**User Flows & Navigation:**
- `user-flows.mmd` - Mermaid diagrams showing how users navigate through the application to complete key tasks

**Responsive & Accessibility:**
- `responsive-design.md` - Guidelines for how the UI adapts across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- `accessibility.md` - Accessibility requirements following WCAG guidelines to ensure inclusive design

For each selected file, provide:
- Short description of what the file contains
- Why it's essential for this specific project
- What key information it should include

**Note:** Select files based on project complexity, target platforms, and user needs. Not all files may be necessary for every project.

#### 2.3 Request User Approval

Present the stage plan to the user and ask - Please check the Stage Proposal file in file `05-ux/README.md`, and update it directly or tell me how to update it

### 3. Execute Stage Plan

Once the user updates & approves the plan in `05-ux/README.md`, read the file and understand user's update for the next step:

#### 3.1 Create All Planned Files

Create each file listed in the approved README.md within the `05-ux/` folder:

- **For `.md` files:** Write comprehensive, well-structured content based on insights from personas, MVP requirements, and PRD
- **For `.mmd` files:** Create clear Mermaid diagrams (user flows, navigation maps) using appropriate syntax
- **For `.html` files:** Create functional, well-commented preview pages demonstrating the design system

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Base design decisions on user personas and their needs identified in stage 02
- Align UX with MVP features defined in stage 03
- Ensure all user flows support the functional requirements from stage 04
- Design system should reflect the product's brand and target audience
- Wireframes should cover all key screens identified in the PRD
- Accessibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum
- Responsive design should prioritize the primary platform (mobile-first or desktop-first based on target users)

#### 3.2 Request User Approval for Files

After creating all files, present them to the user:
- Provide a summary of what was created
- Highlight key design decisions and rationale
- Ask: "Please review the UX design files. You can update or delete the files or let me know how to do it"

### 4. Finalize Stage

Once the user approves all files, you need to check all the files content, and if any files have been deleted understand the user's intent:

#### 4.1 Documentation Finalization
- Sync with `05-ux/README.md`, to remove any deleted files which the user doesn't want to have
- Ensure all files are complete and well-formatted
- Verify that design system is consistent across all wireframes
- Confirm user flows cover all key user journeys from personas
- Check that all Mermaid diagrams render correctly
- Validate that HTML preview displays correctly in browser

#### 4.2 Prepare for Next Stage
- Summarize key design decisions for reference in architecture stage
- Note any technical constraints discovered during UX design (e.g., complex animations, real-time updates)
- Identify design patterns that will influence technology choices in stage 06
- Document any third-party UI frameworks or libraries that align with the design system

#### 4.3 Announce Completion
Inform the user:
- "Stage 05 (UX Design) is complete"
- Summary of deliverables created
- Key design decisions made
- "Ready to proceed to Stage 06 (Architecture) when you are"

## Role Communication

Based on the stage context and project details, pick up your roles from `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

**As a {Role} [and {Role}, ...], I will {action description}**

## Communication Pattern

This communication pattern ensures:
- **Transparency** - Users know exactly what you're doing and why
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** - Users can intervene at key decision points
- **Role clarity** - Clear understanding of which expertise is being applied
- **Traceability** - Easy to track which role made which decisions

Always announce your role and action before:
- Reading and analyzing documents
- Creating new files or documents
- Making design recommendations or decisions
- Requesting user approval
- Finalizing deliverables
