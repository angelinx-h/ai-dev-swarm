# Stage Skipped

This stage is not required for this project because:
- This is an L2 tool with a single, well-defined user persona (developers using AI agents)
- The target audience is clearly defined in 00-init-ideas/target-users.md
- No complex persona segmentation needed for a developer CLI tool
