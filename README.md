# MCP Skills Server

**Status**: Stage 0 - Init Ideas (In Progress)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents without built-in skills support to access and utilize the dev-swarms development framework through standardized MCP tools.

## Project Overview

This project creates an MCP server that bridges the gap between AI agents and the dev-swarms skills framework. It allows any MCP-compatible AI agent to leverage the comprehensive 10-stage development methodology provided by dev-swarms, from initial idea through production deployment.

## Current Stage

📍 **Stage 0: Init Ideas** - [View Documentation](./00-init-ideas/)

Initial project documentation has been created. Review the problem statement, target users, value proposition, and requirements in the `00-init-ideas/` folder.

## How Dev Swarms Works

Dev Swarms is a structured AI-powered development framework that guides you from initial idea to production deployment through a proven 10-stage methodology.

### Planning & Strategy (Stages 0-4)
- **Stage 0: Init Ideas** - Transform informal ideas into professional project documentation ✅ Current
- **Stage 1: Market Research** - Validate the problem and analyze competitive landscape
- **Stage 2: Personas** - Define user personas and prioritized user stories (P0/P1/P2)
- **Stage 3: MVP** - Define minimum viable product scope and success metrics
- **Stage 4: PRD** - Create comprehensive product requirements document

### Design & Architecture (Stages 5-7)
- **Stage 5: UX Design** - Design user flows, interactions, and mockups
- **Stage 6: Architecture** - Define system components, data flow, and deployment boundaries
- **Stage 7: Tech Specs** - Specify tech stack, security, coding standards, and theme guidelines

### Development & Deployment (Stages 8-10)
- **Stage 8: DevOps** - Setup development environment, GitHub, MCP tools, and Docker
- **Stage 9: Sprints** - AI-accelerated feature development with backlogs and testing
- **Stage 10: Deployment** - Deploy to staging/production with CI/CD pipelines

## Key Features (Planned)

- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Standard stdio transport for maximum compatibility
- **Automatic Skill Discovery**: Dynamically discovers and registers all dev-swarms skills
- **Context Injection**: Injects skill instructions into AI agent sessions
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Handles file paths relative to project root
- **Python + FastMCP**: Modern, reliable implementation with uv for dependency management

## Repository Structure

See `dev-swarms/docs/repository-structure.md` for the complete folder structure and file organization.

## Getting Started

1. Review the initial project documentation in `00-init-ideas/`
2. Follow the dev-swarms methodology through each stage
3. Use AI agents to accelerate development and maintain quality
