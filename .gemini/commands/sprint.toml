Process all backlogs in a sprint through the complete workflow: development, review, and test.

Sprint folder location: @09-sprints/SPRINT-*{{args}}*/

Workflow for each backlog in the sprint:

3. List all backlog files in the sprint folder (files matching `FEATURE-*.md`, `CHANGE-*.md`, `BUG-*.md`, `IMPROVE-*.md`)
4. Process each backlog in sequence (respect dependencies noted in README.md)
5. For each backlog, execute the complete dev → review → test workflow
