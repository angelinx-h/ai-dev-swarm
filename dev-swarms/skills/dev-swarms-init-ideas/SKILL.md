# AI Builder - Initialize Ideas

This skill transforms non-technical or non-professional ideas into professional project kickoff documentation with proper structure and business analysis.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "init" or "kickoff" the project
- User wants to start a new project from ideas
- User has an ideas.md file that needs to be formalized
- User wants to create initial project documentation

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Business Owner**: Ensure commercial success and financial viability. Define business goals, identify the problem statement, and articulate value propositions that balance user value with business profitability.
- **Product Manager**: Create compelling products that meet user needs. Conduct research to identify target users, extract requirements, and ensure the product aligns with both user expectations and business goals.

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a Business Owner, I will create problem statements and value propositions
- As a Product Manager, I will create target user documentation and owner requirements
- As a Business Owner, I will ask user to confirm the project kickoff documentation
- As a Business Owner, I will use git tool to initialize repository (if needed)

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Check for ideas.md and Existing Documentation

1. **Check if `00-init-ideas/` folder exists:**
   - If exists: Read all existing files to understand current state
   - If NOT exists: Will create new structure

2. **Check if `ideas.md` exists in the project root:**
   - If exists: Read and analyze the content as input
   - If NOT exists: Ask the user to provide basic ideas for the project, then create `ideas.md`

3. Proceed to Step 2 with gathered context

### Step 2: Extract Project Information

From the ideas.md file and any existing documentation:
1. Identify and pick the best project name
2. Extract key requirements and goals
3. Identify problem statements
4. Identify target users
5. Extract value propositions

### Step 3: Create/Update Project Structure

1. **Create or update README.md** at project root with:
   - Project name
   - Brief description
   - Project status
   - Reference to 00-init-ideas folder

2. **Create/Update folder structure:**
   ```
   00-init-ideas/
   ├── README.md
   ├── problem-statement.md
   ├── target-users.md
   ├── value-proposition.md
   └── owner-requirement.md
   ```

### Step 4: Create/Update Documentation Files

**If files already exist:** Update them based on latest context from ideas.md and user feedback. Improve and refine existing content rather than replacing it entirely.

**If files don't exist:** Create new files with the following structure:

Create the following documentation:

**00-init-ideas/README.md:**
- Specify the owner: Business Owner
- Specify attendances: Product Manager
- Overview of this stage
- Links to all documentation files

**problem-statement.md:**
- Clear description of the problem being solved
- Current pain points
- Why this problem matters

**target-users.md:**
- Who are the target users
- User personas
- User needs and expectations

**value-proposition.md:**
- What value does this project provide
- How it solves the problem
- Unique selling points
- Benefits to users

**owner-requirement.md:**
- All requirements extracted from ideas.md
- Organized by priority or category
- Clear and actionable items

### Step 5: Initialize Git Repository

1. Check if git repository is initialized
2. If not, run `git init`

### Step 6: User Review

1. Ask the user to review the generated documentation in `00-init-ideas/`
2. Ask if they want to conduct `market-research/` (next stage)
3. Make any adjustments based on user feedback

### Step 7: Commit to Git (if user confirms)

1. **If user confirms the contents are good:**
   - Ask if they want to commit to git
2. **If user wants to commit:**
   - Create `99-archive/` folder if it doesn't exist
   - Stage all changes in `00-init-ideas/`
   - Stage the updated README.md
   - Commit with message: "Initialize project with ideas documentation"

## Expected Output Structure

```
project-root/
├── README.md (created/updated)
├── 00-init-ideas/
│   ├── README.md (with owner and attendances)
│   ├── problem-statement.md
│   ├── target-users.md
│   ├── value-proposition.md
│   └── owner-requirement.md
```

## Key Principles

- Transform informal ideas into professional business documentation
- Maintain clear ownership and accountability
- Create actionable, structured documentation
- Archive original ideas after formalization
