# AI Builder - Initialize Ideas

This skill transforms non-technical or non-professional ideas into professional project kickoff documentation with proper structure and business analysis. It intelligently determines project complexity and scale, then creates only the necessary stages and documentation appropriate for the project size.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "init" or "kickoff" the project
- User wants to start a new project from ideas
- User has an ideas.md file that needs to be formalized
- User wants to create initial project documentation

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Business Owner**: Ensure commercial success and financial viability. Define business goals, identify the problem statement, and articulate value propositions that balance user value with business profitability.
- **Product Manager**: Create compelling products that meet user needs. Conduct research to identify target users, extract requirements, and ensure the product aligns with both user expectations and business goals.

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a Business Owner, I will create problem statements and value propositions
- As a Product Manager, I will create target user documentation and owner requirements
- As a Business Owner, I will ask user to confirm the project kickoff documentation
- As a Business Owner, I will use git tool to initialize repository (if needed)

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Check for ideas.md and Existing Documentation

1. **Check if `00-init-ideas/` folder exists:**
   - If exists: Read all existing files to understand current state
   - If NOT exists: Will create new structure

2. **Check if `ideas.md` exists in the project root:**
   - If exists: Read and analyze the content as input
   - If NOT exists: Ask the user to provide basic ideas for the project, then create `ideas.md`

3. Proceed to Step 2 with gathered context

### Step 2: Classify Project Complexity and Scale

1. **Read the classification standard:**
   - Read `dev-swarms/docs/software-dev-classification.md`

2. **Analyze ideas.md to determine:**
   - **Project Purpose (P1-P4):**
     - P1: Personal Tool (individual use, disposable)
     - P2: Internal Tool (team/company use)
     - P3: Open Source Project (public collaboration)
     - P4: Commercial/Profit-Oriented Product

   - **Development Scale (L0-L7):**
     - L0: One-Off Execution (run once, single file)
     - L1: Reusable Script (used repeatedly, basic args)
     - L2: Tool with Environment Setup (dependencies, packaging)
     - L3: Single-Service Application (real app with users)
     - L4: Product MVP (minimal viable product)
     - L5: Multi-Platform MVP (web + mobile)
     - L6: Growth-Stage Product (scaling users/team)
     - L7: Platform/Ecosystem (others build on it)

3. **Document the classification:**
   - Create a classification statement to be included in project README
   - List explicit exclusions based on the scale

### Step 3: Extract Project Information

From the ideas.md file and any existing documentation:
1. Identify and pick the best project name
2. Extract key requirements and goals
3. Identify problem statements
4. Identify target users
5. Extract value propositions

### Step 4: Determine Required Stages Based on Project Scale

Based on the determined scale level, decide which stages are needed:

**For L0-L1 (Very Small Projects - Scripts):**
- 00-init-ideas/README.md (how to implement the script or refined requirements)
- src/script_name.sh (or appropriate extension)
- NO other stages needed

**For L2 (Tool with Environment):**
- 00-init-ideas/ (required)
- 02-personas/ (optional - may SKIP)
- 03-mvp/ (may SKIP for simple tools)
- 04-prd/ (simplified requirements)
- 07-tech-specs/ (minimal)
- 08-devops/ (basic setup)
- 09-sprints/ (feature backlogs)
- SKIP: 01-market-research, 05-ux, 06-architecture, 10-deployment

**For L3-L4 (Single Service / MVP):**
- All stages except possibly 10-deployment (if not deploying to cloud yet)

**For L5-L7 (Multi-Platform / Growth / Platform):**
- ALL stages required (00 through 10)

**Read repository-structure.md for reference:**
- Read `dev-swarms/docs/repository-structure.md` for detailed folder structure
- Note: The files listed in repository-structure.md are samples; adapt based on project needs

### Step 5: Create Project Root README with Classification

1. **Create or update README.md** at project root with:
   - Project name (from ideas.md)
   - Brief description
   - **Project Classification Statement:**
     ```
     Project Purpose: Px
     Development Scale: Lx

     This project explicitly DOES NOT include:
     - [Exclusion 1 based on scale]
     - [Exclusion 2 based on scale]
     - [Exclusion 3 based on scale]
     ```
   - Project status
   - Reference to stage folders

### Step 6: Create Stage Folder Structure

Create folders from `00-init-ideas` through `10-deployment`. For each folder:

1. **00-init-ideas (ALWAYS REQUIRED):**
   - Create README.md listing the docs needed for this stage
   - Give the project a clear title
   - List which docs will be created (based on project scale)

2. **For stages 01-10:**
   - **If the stage is NOT needed for this project scale:**
     - Create `SKIP.md` with explanation:
       ```markdown
       # Stage Skipped

       This stage is not required for this project because:
       - [Reason based on project scale and purpose]
       ```

   - **If the stage IS needed:**
     - Create `README.md` listing the docs that will be created in this stage
     - Use repository-structure.md as reference but adapt to project needs
     - Include comments explaining why each doc is needed
     - **DO NOT create the actual documentation files yet** - only README

3. **Create basic folder structure if needed:**
   - Also create: `features/`, `src/`, `99-archive/`
   - Add `.gitkeep` files to empty folders if necessary

### Step 7: User Confirmation on Structure

1. **Present the proposed structure to the user:**
   - Show which stages will be created
   - Show which stages will be skipped (with reasons)
   - Show the classification statement

2. **Ask user to confirm:**
   - "Does this project structure match your expectations?"
   - "Should any stages be added or removed?"

3. **Make adjustments based on user feedback**

### Step 8: Create 00-init-ideas Documentation

**Once user confirms the structure:**

1. **For L0-L1 projects:**
   - Create detailed 00-init-ideas/README.md with:
     - How to implement the script/tool
     - Requirements and specifications
     - Usage instructions
   - Ask if user wants to proceed with implementation in src/

2. **For L2+ projects:**
   - Create all documentation files in 00-init-ideas/:
     - README.md (owner: Business Owner, attendances: Product Manager)
     - problem-statement.md (clear problem definition)
     - target-users.md (who has the problem, primary audience)
     - value-proposition.md (why this solution matters, core benefits)
     - owner-requirement.md (from ideas.md + constraints for later stages)
     - cost-budget.md (optional - LLM token budget estimation)

**File Content Guidelines:**

**00-init-ideas/README.md:**
- Project title
- Owner: Business Owner
- Attendances: Product Manager
- Overview of this initialization stage
- Links to all documentation files in this folder

**problem-statement.md:**
- Clear description of the problem being solved
- Current pain points
- Why this problem matters
- Constraints and limitations

**target-users.md:**
- Who are the target users (high-level)
- Primary audience
- User needs and expectations

**value-proposition.md:**
- What value does this project provide
- How it solves the problem
- Core benefits to users
- Why this solution matters

**owner-requirement.md:**
- All requirements extracted from ideas.md
- Owner constraints for later stages
- Organized by priority or category
- Clear and actionable items

### Step 9: User Confirmation on 00-init-ideas Content

1. **Ask the user to review:**
   - All generated documentation in `00-init-ideas/`
   - The classification and project structure
   - Content accuracy and completeness

2. **Make any adjustments based on user feedback**

3. **Ask if they want to proceed to the next stage:**
   - For L0-L1: "Would you like me to implement the script in src/?"
   - For L2+: "Would you like me to proceed to the next stage (market-research or personas)?"

### Step 10: Initialize Git Repository (if needed)

1. Check if git repository is initialized
2. If not, run `git init`

### Step 11: Commit to Git (if user confirms)

1. **If user confirms the contents are good:**
   - Ask if they want to commit to git

2. **If user wants to commit:**
   - Stage all created/modified files
   - Use the dev-swarms-draft-commit-message skill to draft the commit message
   - Commit with the drafted message (should follow conventional commit format)
   - Example: "feat: initialize project with ideas documentation and stage structure"

## Key Principles

- **Scale-Appropriate Development**: Create only the documentation and structure necessary for the project scale
- **Prevent Over-Engineering**: Explicitly skip stages that don't apply to the project purpose and scale
- **Clear Classification**: Document project purpose and scale to guide all future decisions
- **Transform Informal to Professional**: Convert non-technical ideas into structured business documentation
- **Maintain Ownership**: Clear ownership and accountability for each stage
- **Explicit Exclusions**: Document what the project will NOT include based on its scale
- **Actionable Documentation**: Create clear, actionable documentation that guides development
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Confirm structure and content with user before proceeding
