# AI Builder - Project Management

This skill manages the complete sprint and backlog lifecycle for AI-driven feature development. As a Project Manager expert, you'll create and organize backlogs, schedule sprints, prioritize work, and maintain the features knowledge base for efficient AI-driven development.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to create or manage sprints
- User requests to create, update, or prioritize backlogs
- User wants to schedule work or plan a sprint
- User asks to archive completed sprints
- User needs to organize features into the knowledge base
- User wants to view sprint status or backlog priorities
- After code review or testing phases identify new backlogs (change/bug/improve)

## Prerequisites

This skill works with the following folder structure:
- `02-personas/` - User personas and user stories that drive backlog scope
- `03-mvp/` - MVP scope and success criteria for initial sprint planning
- `04-prd/` - Product requirements and non-functional constraints
- `05-ux/` - UX flows, states, and mockups that shape backlog acceptance
- `06-architecture/` - System structure and dependencies that affect sequencing

- `09-sprints/` - Active sprint and backlog management
- `99-archive/` - Archived completed sprints (same structure as project root)

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Project Manager**: Lead sprint planning and backlog management across the entire project. Break down epics and user stories into implementable backlogs. Prioritize work based on dependencies, business value, and technical constraints. Schedule backlogs across sprints to maintain steady delivery. Track progress, identify blockers, and adjust plans. Archive completed sprints and organize features into the knowledge base. Maintain project velocity and ensure sprint goals are achievable.

- **Tech Manager (Architect)**: Create backlogs for system architecture, infrastructure, and technical foundations. Define technical stack, frameworks, and development standards. Plan database architecture, API design patterns, and integration strategies. Identify technical dependencies and advise on backlog sequencing (infrastructure before features, backend before frontend). Flag technical risks, complexity estimates, and architectural constraints. Create backlogs for DevOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and system scalability.

- **Product Manager**: Create backlogs that deliver core user value and business objectives. Define MVP scope and prioritize features based on user impact. Ensure backlog descriptions include clear user stories and business rationale. Write well-defined, testable acceptance criteria. Balance feature requests with business goals. Create backlogs for user onboarding, feature discovery, and product analytics. Validate that sprint goals deliver measurable user-facing value.

- **AI Engineer**: Create backlogs for AI/ML features, model architecture, and intelligent system capabilities. Plan LLM integration, prompt engineering strategies, and AI-powered features. Design vector database, embeddings, and semantic search functionality. Create backlogs for model training, evaluation, and monitoring pipelines. Plan AI cost optimization, latency management, and fallback strategies. Design content generation, summarization, and AI moderation systems. Define AI safety, bias detection, and quality assurance processes.

- **Legal Advisor**: Create backlogs for all legal compliance and policy pages. Write Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and GDPR/CCPA compliance documentation. Create disclaimers, liability statements, and user agreements. Plan age verification, consent management, and data handling workflows. Design legal notices, copyright statements, and licensing information. Ensure regulatory compliance for target markets. Create backlogs for user data rights (access, deletion, portability).

- **Customer Support**: Create backlogs for user support infrastructure and self-service resources. Design FAQ pages, help centers, and troubleshooting guides. Plan contact forms, support ticket systems, and user feedback mechanisms. Create knowledge base structure and search functionality. Write onboarding tutorials, feature guides, and best practice documentation. Design chatbot scripts, canned responses, and support automation. Anticipate common user issues and create preventive help content.

- **Content Moderator**: Create backlogs for content moderation systems and community safety features. Design reporting mechanisms, flagging interfaces, and user safety tools. Plan moderation queue, review dashboards, and moderator workflows. Write community guidelines, content policies, and acceptable use terms. Design automated content filtering and manual review processes. Create user communication templates for moderation actions (warnings, suspensions, bans). Plan appeals, dispute resolution, and account restoration workflows.

- **UI Designer**: Create backlogs for user interface design, visual layout, and user experience flows. Design component libraries, design systems, and branding guidelines. Plan responsive layouts, mobile-first designs, and accessibility features. Create navigation structures, information architecture, and user flow diagrams. Design call-to-action buttons, form layouts, and interactive elements. Ensure visual consistency across all pages and components. Plan animations, transitions, and micro-interactions. Make complex information (legal docs, technical content) readable and user-friendly.

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a Project Manager, I will create backlogs by breaking down user stories into implementable tasks
- As a Tech Manager, I will create technical architecture and infrastructure backlogs with dependency sequencing
- As a Product Manager, I will define acceptance criteria and test plans for each backlog
- As a AI Engineer, I will create backlogs for AI/ML features and integration strategies
- As a Legal Advisor, I will create backlogs for compliance documentation and policy pages
- As a Customer Support, I will create backlogs for help documentation and support infrastructure
- As a Content Moderator, I will create backlogs for moderation systems and community guidelines
- As a UI Designer, I will create backlogs for UI components and design system implementation
- As a Project Manager, I will prioritize backlogs and schedule them across sprints based on dependencies and business value
- As a Project Manager, I will ask user to confirm sprint plan and backlog priorities before starting development

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Backlog Types

There are 4 types of backlogs:

1. **feature** - A new feature request (initial development)
2. **change** - Modifications to an existing feature (initial eature request didn't meet design requirements)
3. **bug** - Defects found during code review or testing to a feature
4. **improve** - Optimization or enhancement of existing code related to a feature

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 0: Verify Prerequisites and Gather Context

0. **Review planning inputs before initializing sprints/backlogs:**
   - `02-personas/` for personas and prioritized user stories
   - `03-mvp/` for scope boundaries and MVP success metrics
   - `04-prd/` for functional and non-functional requirements
   - `05-ux/` for user flows, UI states, and mockup constraints
   - `06-architecture/` for sequencing dependencies and system boundaries
   - `07-tech-specs/` for technology choices and standards
   - `08-devops/` for environment/tooling readiness and constraints

1. **Check if `09-sprints/` folder exists:**
   - If NOT found: Create new folder structure with `README.md` refer to `templates/sprints-readme.md`
   - If found: Read `sprints-index.md` to understand current sprint status

2. **Check if `features/` folder exists:**
   - If NOT found: no any feature completed, ignore it for now
   - If found: Read `features-index.md` to understand implemented features

3. **Use templates for consistency:**
   - Templates are located in this skill's `templates/` folder
   - Use templates when creating sprints, backlogs, sprints-index, and test plans
   - Templates provide standard formats for consistency

4. **Understand user request:**
   - Are they creating a new backlog?
   - Are they scheduling a sprint?
   - Are they archiving completed work?
   - Are they adding to features knowledge base?

### Step 1: Managing Backlogs

#### Creating a New Backlog

When creating backlogs, each must include:

1. **Title and Type:**
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Type: feature, change, bug, or improve
   - If modifying existing feature, type should be `change`, `bug`, or `improve`

2. **Task Description:**
   - What needs to be done from user perspective
   - Why this work is needed
   - Success criteria

3. **Reference Features:**
   - List features from `features/` that are related if have
   - These provide context without reading entire project
   - Reference `features/features-index.md` to find relevant features

4. **Test Plan:**
   - How to verify the backlog is complete
   - Should be testable by non-technical users when possible
   - Include curl commands, CLI steps, or web UI tests

5. **Priority:**
   - Set initial priority (will be refined during sprint planning)
   - Consider dependencies and business value

#### Updating Backlog Status

Track backlog lifecycle:
- **Not Started** - Backlog created but not in active sprint
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **In Review** - Code complete, awaiting review
- **Testing** - Under test
- **Done** - Completed and verified

### Step 2: Sprint Planning

#### Creating a Sprint

Each sprint should have:

1. **Sprint Goals:**
   - Clear objectives for the sprint
   - What will be delivered to end users

2. **Backlog Selection (5-7 backlogs recommended):**
   - Mix of feature, change, bug, and improve types
   - Consider dependencies between backlogs
   - Ensure backlogs are properly sized

3. **End User Test Plan:**
   - Comprehensive test plan for the entire sprint
   - Should be executable by non-technical users
   - Could be used in a customer showcase/demo meeting
   - Include curl, web UI, or CLI commands
   - NOT just unit tests or log checks

4. **Sprint Timeline:**
   - Estimated duration
   - Key milestones

### Step 3: Prioritizing and Scheduling

#### Prioritization Criteria

When new backlogs are created (by code review or test skills):

1. **Assess Priority:**
   - sprints and backlogs are ordered by priority
   - the top one is the highest priority

2. **Assign to Sprint:**
   - Add to current sprint if capacity allows
   - Otherwise, add to a planned sprint or create a new sprint
   - Update both `README.md` files in folder `09-sprints/` and sprint folder with priority order

## Expected Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── 09-sprints/
│   ├── README.md (all sprints with priority sorted links)
│   ├── sprint-name-b/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── {BACKLOG_TYPE}-{feature-name-d}.md
│   │   ├── {BACKLOG_TYPE}-{feature-name-e}.md
│   │   ├── {BACKLOG_TYPE}-{feature-name-f}.md
│   └── sprint-name-c/
│       └── ...
```

## Available Templates

This skill provides the following templates in the `templates/` folder:

1. **sprints-readme.md** - Template for README.md in `09-sprints/`
2. **sprint-readme.md** - Template for README.md in each sprint folder
3. **backlog.md** - Template for creating backlog file in each sprint folder

Use these templates when creating new sprints and backlogs to ensure consistency across the project.
