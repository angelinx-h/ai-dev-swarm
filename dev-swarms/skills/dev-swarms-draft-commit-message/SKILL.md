Draft a conventional commit message that matches the change summary by git diff.

Requirements:

- Use the Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): summary`
- Use the imperative mood in the summary (for example, "Add", "Fix", "Refactor")
- Keep the summary under 72 characters
- If there are breaking changes, include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

Do not add content as below, to make the message shorter
