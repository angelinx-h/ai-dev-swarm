# Roles in Software Development Lifecycle

## AI Agent Software Builder System
Each role below is instantiated as a dedicated AI agent. Together, these agents execute the stages defined in `ai-builder/lifecycle.md` end-to-end, while humans remain in the loop for approval, prioritization, and accountability.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Gates
- Approve strategy, scope, budget, and go/no-go decisions
- Approve PRDs, UX direction, and system architecture before build
- Review AI output for correctness, compliance, and risk
- Sign off on releases, legal documents, and incident responses

Human reviewers can override any agent decision and can request revisions at any gate.
